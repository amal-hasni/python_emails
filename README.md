This is a repository containing ready-to-use code for different methods to send emails using Python.

- There are four different methods to use:
1. To send an email written in plain text, use the code in **plain_text_email.py**
2. To send an email written under HTML format, use the code in **html_email_with_attachments.py**
3. To send an email written under Markdown format, use the code in **markdown_email.py**
4. To send an email with TraceBack information (in case an error occurs), use the code in **mail_traceback.py**

- Don't forget to add your own information in the Personal information section variables at the top of each script.

- Also make sure to install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
